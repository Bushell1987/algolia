# algolia
create an api with the required scopes in algolia

!!!!ensure that you are using a testing environment in algolia with like-for-like products that ar on the production  !!!!

https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/methods/indexing/
https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-python

using the algo_push_objects.csv edit the data to match existing objectids

ideally you would have this data in a database for get/push automation

Using the full_update.py push the tags into the testing environment



Notes
This process has been simplified for most users that are not on shopify
